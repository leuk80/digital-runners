Many businesses start out with simple consumer routers and budget WiFi access points. That works at first – but as soon as more employees, more devices and higher demands come into play, the limitations of these devices become apparent.

## What is UniFi?

UniFi is a network product line from Ubiquiti, developed specifically for professional and semi-professional environments. What makes it special: all components – access points, switches, gateways and cameras – are managed through a single interface, the **UniFi Network Controller**.

## Key Benefits at a Glance

### Centralised Management

Instead of configuring each device individually, you manage your entire network in one place. Whether you run 2 or 200 access points – the effort stays manageable.

### Scalability

UniFi grows with you. Start with a simple setup and expand step by step – without having to rebuild everything from scratch. New sites can be integrated seamlessly into your existing infrastructure.

### Professional Features

VLANs for network segmentation, VPN connectivity, detailed traffic monitoring, guest networks with captive portal – everything is included and available at no extra cost.

### Reliability

UniFi devices are built for continuous operation. Regular firmware updates continuously improve stability and security.

## Who is UniFi suitable for?

UniFi is suitable for almost any business size and industry: from small offices to hotels, medical practices, and large industrial and logistics facilities. Wherever a reliable, professionally managed network is required.

## Conclusion

Switching to UniFi is an investment in stability, security and future-readiness. With the right partner at your side, the migration is straightforward – and the difference is immediately noticeable.
