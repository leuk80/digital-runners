Digital transformation is on everyone's lips – but what does it really mean? Too often it is reduced to the introduction of new software or a migration to the cloud. But that falls short.

## Technology is a means, not an end

The key question is not "Which tools should we use?" but "How do we want to work in the future and what value do we create for our customers?" Technology is an important means to that end – but it is just a means.

## People first

Every successful transformation starts with people. Employees need to understand why change is necessary and be given the skills to adopt new ways of working. Change management is not an optional extra, but a central success factor.

## Processes before digitalisation

A bad process that is digitalised is still a bad process – just faster. That is why workflows should be analysed, simplified and optimised before being automated.

## Culture as the foundation

Agility, a willingness to learn, and a culture that allows experimentation – these are the cultural foundations without which no digital transformation can succeed in the long term.

## Conclusion

Digital transformation is a strategic leadership issue. Those who delegate it as an IT project give away the decisive potential. Start with the question: *What difference do we want to make for our customers?* – and derive your digital strategy from that.
