Who hasn't experienced it: an employee leaves the company, and somewhere out there a key exists whose whereabouts are unclear. Or the lock needs replacing because a key has gone missing. Traditional key systems are not just inconvenient – they are a security risk.

UniFi Access solves this problem with an elegant, fully digital access system that integrates seamlessly into the UniFi ecosystem.

## What Is UniFi Access?

UniFi Access is an access control solution from Ubiquiti that makes physical doors manageable via NFC cards, key fobs or smartphones. The system is administered through the **UniFi Access Hub** and managed within the existing UniFi Controller – the same interface used for network, cameras and more.

Each door is fitted with a **UniFi Access Reader** – an elegant device mounted directly at the door, powered via PoE (Power over Ethernet). Concealed wiring in the wall remains optional.

## Key Features

### NFC Cards and Key Fobs

Employees receive an NFC card or key fob that they hold against the reader to open the door. The card can be deactivated instantly through the app – no lock replacement needed, no waiting for physical return.

### Mobile Unlock via Smartphone

With the **UniFi Access App**, employees can open doors using their smartphone – via Bluetooth (when nearby) or through remote access. No physical medium required.

**Touch ID / Face ID**: On iPhones and Android devices, authentication can be combined with biometric unlocking for an additional layer of security.

### Intercom with Camera and Audio

UniFi Access readers with camera (such as the UA-Intercom Pro) include an integrated intercom with two-way audio and video preview. When someone rings the bell, their image appears on screen – and the door can be opened with a tap, without leaving your desk.

### Integration with UniFi Protect

When someone rings the doorbell, the camera image from the access reader automatically appears on the UniFi Protect dashboard and on connected UniFi Talk phones. True end-to-end integration – doorbell, video and door release in one interface.

### Access Rights and Schedules

Through the **UniFi Access Controller**, you define precise access rights:

- Which employee may open which doors?
- At what times is access permitted (e.g. Monday–Friday, 07:00–19:00 only)?
- Which groups receive temporary guest access?

Changes take effect immediately – no keys to collect, no locks to replace.

### Complete Access Log

Every access attempt is logged: who, when, at which door, using which authentication method. The log can be filtered, exported and is suitable for compliance documentation.

## Typical Use Cases

**Offices and law firms**: Employees use their own card, visitors receive day badges. Server rooms and archives are accessible only to authorised personnel.

**Healthcare**: Medication stores and treatment rooms are opened only for the authorised staff. Access is fully logged and audit-ready.

**Hotels**: Guests receive a digital room key card at check-in. After check-out, access is automatically deactivated – no manual card collection needed.

**Warehouses and production facilities**: Access to high-security areas or material stores is limited to specific shifts or teams.

**Schools and educational institutions**: Staff rooms, server rooms and archive rooms are inaccessible to students – opened only with a staff card.

## What Is Needed for Installation?

- **UniFi Access Hub**: The central control unit, connected to the network
- **UniFi Access Reader**: One per door (inside and/or outside)
- **Electric lock**: Magnetic lock or electric door strike (installed by an electrician)
- **PoE switch or PoE injector**: Power for hub and readers
- **Existing UniFi Controller**: No separate system required – runs on the same UniFi infrastructure

## Conclusion

UniFi Access is the natural extension of a UniFi network into physical security. Anyone already running UniFi Network or UniFi Protect can add professional access control with minimal effort – no additional software, no separate management systems.

The advantages over traditional key systems are clear: no lock replacements when keys are lost, instant remote deactivation, complete audit logging and precise scheduling.
